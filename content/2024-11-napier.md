## Review Summary

**Napier V2**

Napier V2 is a liquidity hub for future yield trading.

The contracts of the Napier V2 [Repo](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/) were reviewed over twenty days. Two auditors performed the code review between November 4th and November 29th, 2023. The repository was under active development during the review, but the review was limited to the latest commit, [cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/tree/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02) for the Napier V2 repo.

## Critical Findings

None

## High Findings

None

## Medium Findings

None

## Low Findings

### 1. Low - Missing EIP-5202 blueprint format validation

#### Technical Details

The [`LibBlueprint`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/utils/LibBlueprint.sol#L4-L4) library is designed to work with EIP-5202 blueprint contracts but lacks proper validation of blueprint format. While it skips the first 3 bytes when extracting creation code (in extractCreationCode()), it doesn't verify these bytes match the EIP-5202 specification:

- 0xFE (Execution halt byte)
- 0x71 (Blueprint identifier byte)
- 0x00 (Version byte)

Any contract with more than 3 bytes of code could be used as a "blueprint", even if it doesn't follow the EIP-5202 format.

#### Impact

Low.

#### Recommendation

As part of `extractCreationCode`add the following code after the size check:

```solidity
// Validate blueprint header bytes
bytes memory code = new bytes(3);
assembly {
    extcodecopy(_blueprint, add(code, 32), 0, 3)
}

if (code[0] != 0xFE || code[1] != 0x71 || code[2] != 0x00) {
    revert InvalidBlueprint();
}
```

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged.

### 2. Low - Contract with payable function doesn't use native ETH

The following contract can receive ETH but can not withdraw it: ETH may be sent by users by mistake, and it will be stuck in the contract.

#### Technical Details

```solidity
File: src/modules/deployers/TwoCryptoDeployer.sol

15: contract TwoCryptoDeployer is IPoolDeployer {
```

[TwoCryptoDeployer.sol#L15](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/modules/deployers/TwoCryptoDeployer.sol#L15)

#### Impact

Low.

#### Recommendation

Remove the payable function modifier.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

### 3. Low - Missing zero split check in FeeModule.sol

The split fee is checked to differ from zero on update but not on initialization.

#### Technical Details

The `_splitRatio` parameter is validated to be different than zero in [`updateFeeSplitRatio()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/audit/yAudit/src/modules/FeeModule.sol#L87) but no check is done in [`initialize()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/audit/yAudit/src/modules/FeeModule.sol#L33), allowing the split to be initially zero.

#### Impact

Low.

#### Recommendation

Add the check to `initialize()`.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [f8efff8](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/205/commits/f8efff88fc108db3c6f50453857c0c072eaf30fb)

### 4. Low - Unchecked token amounts in `swap()` function can lead to token drainage

#### Technical Details

Two related issues in the swap function could lead to unintended token transfers:

1. Missing ETH Value Validation

```solidity
File: AggregationRouter.sol

53:         (bool success,) = router.call{value: tokenIn.isNative() ? amountIn : 0}(data.payload);
```

The function doesn't verify that `msg.value` matches `amountIn` when performing native ETH swaps. This allows users to execute swaps without providing the specified ETH amount.

2. Unsafe Return of Excess Tokens

```solidity
File: AggregationRouter.sol

61:         if (returnAmount == 0) revert Errors.AggregationRouter_ZeroReturn();
62:         if (tokenIn.isNative()) {
63:             SafeTransferLib.safeTransferAllETH(msg.sender);
64:         } else {
65:             SafeTransferLib.safeTransferAll(tokenIn.unwrap(), msg.sender);
66:         }
```

After a swap, the contract returns ALL remaining input-type tokens to the caller. This means if the contract holds any excess tokens (either from previous transactions or direct transfers), they can be drained by performing a minimal swap.

1. Contract holds 100 USDC
2. The attacker performs a swap with 0.000001 USDC input
3. After the swap completes, safeTransferAll will return all 100 USDC to the attacker

#### Impact

Low.

#### Recommendation

1. Add ETH value validation:
2. Only return the unused portion of the input amount using before and after balances on the `AgregationRouter`contract.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [dccf68](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/143/commits/dccf682bc74f9660c16a7a5f8d2f409ca9e32245)

### 5. Low - Potential overflow in blueprint code length

The `initcode` length is unsafely cast to 16 bits while preparing the blueprint deployment code.

#### Technical Details

The implementation of [`blueprint()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/utils/LibBlueprint.sol#L43) unsafely casts the length of the given `initcode` when constructing the deployment code for the blueprint.

```solidity
50:         bytes2 len = bytes2(uint16(blueprint_bytecode.length));
```

#### Impact

Low. If the length exceeds `type(uint16).max`, the deployment will most likely fail due to the contract size limitation.

#### Recommendation

Use a safe cast wrapper to convert the length of `initcode` to `uint16`.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [db8fbea](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/194/commits/db8fbea4bcc1d16c41595b369269c78627ce5737)

### 6. Low - Inconsistent fee rounding

Some fees are calculated by rounding down, while other fees are rounded up.

#### Technical Details

- Performance fee rounds up: [YieldMathLib.sol#L75](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/utils/YieldMathLib.sol#L75)
- Issuance and redemption fee rounds down: [PrincipalToken.sol#L778](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L778) - [PrincipalToken.sol#L783](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L783)
- Split fee rounds down: [PrincipalToken.sol#L618](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L618)
- Post settlement fee rounds up: [PrincipalToken.sol#L655](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L655)

#### Impact

Low.

#### Recommendation

Consider normalizing the fee rounding behavior.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [e299936](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/201/commits/e299936ffe71befe1c0821a4bbabec6f394add57)

### 7. Low - Missing recover rewards feature for curator and protocol

While users can claim rewards for arbitrary tokens, the same isn't available for tokens assigned to the curator or the protocol.

#### Technical Details

Users can collect rewards for arbitrary tokens by using the [`collectRewards()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L422) which takes an array of addresses as input. As the documentation indicates, this function allows users to claim tokens for rewards not listed in `RewardProxyModule.rewardTokens()`.

However, this feature isn't available for curator or protocol rewards. These rewards also follow the exact mechanism as user rewards, but both [`collectCuratorFees()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L928) and [`collectProtocolFees()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L944) rely on the list returned by `RewardProxyModule.rewardTokens()`.

#### Impact

Low. Rewards assigned to the curator or protocol could be locked in the contract.

#### Recommendation

Add a function similar to `collectRewards()` to allow the curator or protocol to specify the list of tokens.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [12ae43b](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/200/commits/12ae43b95ec686d12e574f1d0738e9872049a964)

### 8. Low - Validate call value is empty when the token is not native

When pulling tokens in TwoCryptoZap.sol, the implementation doesn't validate that the call value is zero when the input token is not native.

#### Technical Details

The implementation of [`_pullToken()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/zap/TwoCryptoZap.sol#L1184) validates that `msg.value` matches the given `amount` when the input token is ETH, but doesn't validate that `msg.value` is zero when dealing with ERC20 tokens.

#### Impact

Low.

#### Recommendation

When the token is not native, check `msg.value` is zero.

```diff
    function _pullToken(Token token, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (token.isNative()) {
            if (msg.value != amount) revert Errors.Zap_InconsistentETHReceived();
        } else {
+           if (msg.value != 0) revert Errors.Zap_InconsistentETHReceived();
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(token.unwrap(), msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        }
    }
```

#### Developer Response

Fixed [06f3019](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/187/commits/06f3019939b5f201b9aa46f953ea2609054d4f1c) and [42c9228](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/187/commits/42c92288805a762842c1e886567be02964d75f48)

### 9. Low - Missing refund for PT leftover in `swapYtForToken()` and `swapYtForAnyToken()`

Excess of PT tokens resulting from the swap operation are not refunded to the caller.

#### Technical Details

Aside from the broken assumption that `get_dy(get_dx(maxPrincipal)) <= maxPrincipal`, the implementation of [`swapYtForToken()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/zap/TwoCryptoZap.sol#L736) and [`swapYtForAnyToken()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/zap/TwoCryptoZap.sol#L760) fail to consider any potential excess of PT tokens resulting from the swap operation in the Curve pool.

These functions use the flash-loan style of `combine()`, swapping a portion of the received shares for PT. After the hook is called, the PT contract will burn the `principal` amount of PT and YT tokens. This means that there is an implicit check that the result of the swap operation, let's call it `principalDy`, is at least `principal` to cover the cost of `combine() fully`. Any potential difference in `principalDy - principal` is not refunded to the caller.

#### Impact

Low.

#### Recommendation

Refund the PT leftover from the swap to the caller.

Additionally, consider moving the `sharesDx` calculation off-chain and taking this parameter along with the `principal` amount as inputs to the function. This will simplify the implementation and help save gas by avoiding the `get_dy()` and `get_dx()` calls.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [fe79808fa45616a9ad9590c0ffcde766934a9661](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/commit/fe79808fa45616a9ad9590c0ffcde766934a9661#diff-b1dee02e2b352622cf0ee033b3c942d99a06607d16c4503d4c2ad6dda45b915c) and [1bda83f](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/203/commits/1bda83f1dfc33a444d10ecd3123d12ba9f870c16)

### 10. Low - Chain reorganization attack on Principal Token deployment

Principal Token deployments are vulnerable to chain reorganization attacks, where an attacker could deploy a malicious PT contract at the same address and exploit subsequent contract interactions.

#### Technical Details

The Factory.sol contract [deploys](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/Factory.sol#L99) new Principal Tokens using CREATE2 with a salt composed of the chain id, the expiry timestamp and the address of the resolver.

```solidity
116:         bytes32 salt = EfficientHashLib.hash(block.chainid, expiry, uint256(uint160(resolver)));
117:         pt = LibBlueprint.computeCreate2Address(salt, suite.ptBlueprint, "");
```

The resolver contract is deployed using CREATE, which depends on the next nonce available in the factory contract account.

```solidity
112:         address resolver = LibBlueprint.create(suite.resolverBlueprint, suite.resolverArgs);
```

```solidity
78:     function _create(address _blueprint, bytes memory args) private returns (address deployed) {
79:         bytes memory initcode = extractCreationCode(_blueprint);
80:         // Combine initcode with constructor arguments
81:         bytes memory deployCode = bytes.concat(initcode, args);
82:
83:         // Deploy the contract
84:         assembly {
85:             deployed := create(0, add(deployCode, 32), mload(deployCode))
86:         }
87:
88:         if (deployed == address(0)) revert DeploymentFailed();
89:         return deployed;
90:     }
91:
```

This means that an attacker can replace or front-run a deployment and end up with the same contract address as long as they keep the same expiry date. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because the attacker can manipulate the resolver creation arguments and control the `scale()` function, as these parameters do not influence the resolver contract's address.

#### Impact

Low. While the potential impact could be critical, executing this attack would be extremely difficult. The natural margin between deployment and subsequent interactions makes this attack impractical in real-world scenarios.

#### Recommendation

This vulnerability can be mitigated by including the creation arguments in the contract address determination or incorporating the caller's address as part of the salt. Either solution ensures that any modification to these parameters results in a different contract address.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [5b15503](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/199/commits/5b1550350ce773addae06a52456c958d90ccf865)

### 11. Low - Potential reentrancy in module initialization

The `initializer` modifier from the base module implementation allows reentrancy during the initialization process.

#### Technical Details

The implementation of the [`initializer`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/modules/BaseModule.sol#L41) modifier in the BaseModule.sol contract sets the initialized variable after giving control to the decorated logic, allowing for potential reentrancy.

```solidity
41:     modifier initializer() {
42:         bool initialized;
43:         assembly {
44:             initialized := sload(_INITIALIZABLE_SLOT)
45:         }
46:         if (initialized) revert Errors.Module_AlreadyInitialized();
47:         _;
48:         assembly {
49:             sstore(_INITIALIZABLE_SLOT, 0x1) // Set `s_initialized` to true
50:         }
51:     }
```

#### Impact

Low.

#### Recommendation

Update the storage variable before executing the initialization logic.

```diff
    modifier initializer() {
        bool initialized;
        assembly {
            initialized := sload(_INITIALIZABLE_SLOT)
        }
        if (initialized) revert Errors.Module_AlreadyInitialized();
-       _;
        assembly {
            sstore(_INITIALIZABLE_SLOT, 0x1) // Set `s_initialized` to true
        }
+       _;
    }
```

#### Developer Response

Fixed [f9de9ac](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/185/commits/f9de9ac19f69451bec7d1b39e3331c2837e9ebf6)

### 12. Low - Non-standard redemption path may allow bypassing redemption fees

Once matured, the PT can be redeemed using `unite()` or `combine()`, which do not charge redemption fees.

#### Technical Details

Both [`unite()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L296) and [`combine()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L333) can be used after the expiry date. As opposed to [`redeem()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L517) or [`withdraw()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L490), these functions do not charge a redemption fee. If PT holders can get free or cheap YT, combining rather than redeeming might be more cost-effective, bypassing the protocol and curator fees.

#### Impact

Low. Although the dynamics of the PT and YT tokens are difficult to predict, combining PT and YT tokens to redeem the underlying might be more profitable than using the standard redemption path, which charges a fee.

#### Recommendation

Disallow `unite()` and `combine()` once the PT has expired, or include a redemption fee to mimic the behavior of `redeem()` and `withdraw()`.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [74f89dd](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/206/commits/74f89dd7cf300b584094ccac9660fdcb9a33cf42).

## Gas Saving Findings

### 1. Gas - Optimize FeeModule parameters storage using bit packing

The `ConstantFeeModule` currently stores fee parameters using a struct-based approach and relies on the `FeePctsLib` for packing/unpacking operations. This implementation can be optimized using bit manipulation to store all fee parameters in a single storage slot.

#### Technical Details

Five different values must be unpacked and repacked to save the new value. It's possible to update only the most left part of the variable using masks.

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

+ uint256 private constant SPLIT_RATIO_OFFSET = 0;
// Update the value stored using masks

### 2. Gas - Unnecessary variable loading in `_collectFeeRewards`

#### Technical Details

```solidity
File: PrincipalToken.sol
967:             (uint256 curatorReward, uint256 protocolReward) =
968:                 (s_rewardRecords[rewardTokens[i]].curatorReward, s_rewardRecords[rewardTokens[i]].protocolReward); // 1 SLOAD
969:
970:             rewards[i].token = rewardTokens[i];
971:             if (isCurator) {
972:                 rewards[i].amount = curatorReward;
973:                 s_rewardRecords[rewardTokens[i]].curatorReward = 0;
974:             } else {
975:                 rewards[i].amount = protocolReward;
976:                 s_rewardRecords[rewardTokens[i]].protocolReward = 0;
977:             }
```

The code loads `curatorReward` and `protocolReward` when only one of the two will be used; it also creates an intermediary memory variable used only once. The code can be changed to set rewards[i].amount using the storage variable.

[PrincipalToken.sol#L928-L951](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L928-L951)

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Remove line 968 and change the code:

973:                 s_rewardRecords[rewardTokens[i]].curatorReward = 0;
974:             } else {
-975:                 rewards[i].amount = protocolReward;
+975:                 rewards[i].amount = s_rewardRecords[rewardTokens[i]].protocolReward;
976:                 s_rewardRecords[rewardTokens[i]].protocolReward = 0;

### 3. Gas - Use minDy value when possible to reduce gas usage in case of failure

The gas usage will be reduced for transactions.

#### Technical Details

In this example, the `minDy` should be set to `params.minPrincipal`. The curve pool executing the swap will check the amount out before performing the transfers, which will reduce the gas usage in case of a revert.

```solidity
File: TwoCryptoZap.sol
428:         ptOut =
429:             twoCrypto.exchange_received({i: TARGET_INDEX, j: PT_INDEX, dx: shares, minDy: 0, receiver: address(this)});
430:
431:         if (ptOut < params.minPrincipal) revert Errors.Zap_InsufficientPrincipalTokenOutput();
432:
```

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Use `params.minPrincipal` instead of zero as a minDy parameter and remove the check.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

### 4. Gas - TwoCrypto pool can send the output tokens directly to the receiver

In some functions of TwoCryptoZap.sol, the implementation sends the exchange output to the zapper contract, only to forward it to the end receiver.

#### Technical Details

[`swapTokenForPt()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/zap/TwoCryptoZap.sol#L404)

```solidity
427:         // Swap shares for PT using TwoCrypto
428:         ptOut =
429:             twoCrypto.exchange_received({i: TARGET_INDEX, j: PT_INDEX, dx: shares, minDy: 0, receiver: address(this)});
430:
431:         if (ptOut < params.minPrincipal) revert Errors.Zap_InsufficientPrincipalTokenOutput();
432:
433:         // Transfer PT to the receiver
434:         SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(address(principalToken), params.receiver, ptOut);
```

[`swapAnyTokenForPt()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/zap/TwoCryptoZap.sol#L442)

```solidity
477:         // Step 3: Swap shares for PT using TwoCrypto
478:         ptOut = twoCrypto.exchange_received({i: TARGET_INDEX, j: PT_INDEX, dx: shares, minDy: 0});
479:
480:         if (ptOut < params.minPrincipal) revert Errors.Zap_InsufficientPrincipalTokenOutput();
481:
482:         // Transfer PT to the receiver
483:         SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(address(principalToken), params.receiver, ptOut);
```

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Set the receiver of the exchange as the end receiver to save one token transfer.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [b568f66](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/186/commits/b568f66d8db1c7b748d8a23e77b4100e9d13b0e0).

### 5. Gas - Inefficient token transfers and yield accrual in TwoCryptoZap combine operations

In the TwoCryptoZap.combine() function, there are two inefficient aspects:

1. Two unnecessary ERC20 token transfers (PT and YT) from the user to the zap contract
2. Double accrual of yield due to these transfers

The function transfers PT and YT tokens to the TwoCryptoZap contract before combining them. This requires two separate ERC20 transfers and triggers unnecessary yield accruals - first during the YT transfer via `onYtTransfer()` and then again when calling `PrincipalToken.combine()`.
This implementation could be more gas efficient by allowing the PrincipalToken contract to directly spend and burn the tokens from the user's address, similar to how `redeem()` works.

#### Technical Details

1. In `TwoCryptoZap.combine()`: The YT transfer triggers two transfers that trigger [`onYtTransfer()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L459-L459) which accrues yield.

2. In `PrincipalToken.combine()`: It is called which accrues yield again.

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Modify the `PrincipalToken.combine()` function to accept an optional `owner` parameter and add logic to spend allowance to burn PT and YT directly, similar to how `redeem()` works. This would allow `TwoCryptoZap` to combine tokens in a single operation without requiring separate transfers.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged.

### 6. Gas - Inefficient check in AggregationRouter.sol

The zero amount check during swap can be converted into a slippage check.

#### Technical Details

The [`swap()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/modules/aggregator/AggregationRouter.sol#L37) function has a check to ensure the output amount is at least greater than zero. This check can be easily turned into a slippage check by adding a minimum amount argument to the function that could serve both purposes.

For example, this can be used from TwoCryptoZap.sol to execute the swap and check the slippage in the same call.

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Add a slippage check in favor of the zero-amount check.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged

### 7. Gas - Public function in a library

The [`computeCreate2Address()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/utils/LibBlueprint.sol#L130) function present in LibBlueprint.sol is declared as `public` which will require a contract deployment and a delegate call to access it.

#### Technical Details

```solidity
130:     function computeCreate2Address(bytes32 salt, address _blueprint, bytes memory args)
131:         public
132:         view
133:         returns (address addr)
134:     {
135:         bytes32 bytecodeHash = keccak256(bytes.concat(extractCreationCode(_blueprint), args));
136:         return computeAddress(salt, bytecodeHash, address(this));
137:     }
```

#### Impact

Gas savings.

#### Recommendation

Change the function's visibility to `internal`.

### 5. Informational - Remove uncheck loop increments

### Summary

Starting from [Solidity 0.8.22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.22), it is no longer necessary to use `unchecked` blocks for loop increments to save gas. The compiler now handles this optimization by default.

### Technical Details

The codebase contains several instances where `unchecked` blocks are used for loop increments. With the release of Solidity 0.8.22, these `unchecked` blocks are redundant and can be safely removed. By default, the compiler now performs gas-saving optimizations for loop increments.

Example:

```solidity
unchecked {
    ++i;
}
```

### 8. Informational - Permits can be front-run in order to grief collections

The collector approval permission can be front-run to cause the collection transaction to fail due to an expired nonce.

#### Technical Details

In [`collectWithPermit()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/zap/TwoCryptoZap.sol#L986) and [`collectRewardsWithPermit()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/zap/TwoCryptoZap.sol#L1003) the caller bundles a signature to grant collection permissions to the zapper contract.

A malicious actor can use any of those signatures directly in the PrincipalToken.sol contract, causing the front-running transaction to fail since the permission will now be invalid.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Consider checking if the zapper is already an approved collector for the caller before executing the permit.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged.

### 9. Informational - Inaccurate documentation

Several comments in the contracts are not aligned with how the system works.

#### Technical Details

> The curator CAN grant and revoke roles for a PrincipalToken instance and its FeeModule instance.

The FeeModule is managed by the factory AccessManager, not by the curator.

> The curator CAN change the fee module for a PrincipalToken instance.

Same as before, the FeeModule cannot be updated.

> Napier CAN change the reward proxy for a PrincipalToken instance.

The protocol cannot update the modules for a PT instance.

The [`ModuleAccessor.get()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/utils/ModuleAccessor.sol#L19) function says that "_The module index is zero-based and id out of range does not revert_", but the implementation reverts when the index is out of range.

In [ExternalPriceResolver.sol](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/modules/resolvers/ExternalPriceResolver.sol#L35), the associated comments in the `scale()` function mention the following:

> The price from the external feed is assumed to be in 18 decimal precision.

This is incorrect. The price from the external feed should be expressed in the domain of the asset's number of decimals, which matches the PT/YT decimals. As the function returns `price * offset` (similarly to the other resolvers), the resulting conversion to principal would be `shares * price * offset / 1e18`, meaning that price should reflect the principal's decimals.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Correct the wording in the mentioned comments.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [861d845](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/213/commits/861d8450007d56458c75750e63a339ac3629e8bb)

### 10. Informational - Memory-safe annotation preferred over comment variant

#### Technical Details

The memory-safe annotation (`assembly ("memory-safe") { ... }`), available starting in Solidity version 0.8.13 is preferred over the comment variant, which will be removed in a future breaking [release](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/assembly.html#memory-safety). The comment variant is only meant for externalized library code that needs to work in earlier versions (e.g. `SafeTransferLib` needs to be able to be used in many different versions).

### 11. Informational - `maxRedeem()` and `maxWithdraw()` fail to account for token maturity

The [`maxRedeem()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L892) and [`maxWithdraw()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L896) functions return non-zero amounts before expiry.

#### Technical Details

```solidity
892:     function maxRedeem(address owner) external view returns (uint256) {
893:         return balanceOf(owner);
894:     }
895:
896:     function maxWithdraw(address owner) external view returns (uint256) {
897:         return convertToUnderlying(balanceOf(owner));
898:     }
```

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Consider returning zero if the Principal Token has not expired.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [13f1724](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/196/commits/13f1724969f48138e953e6e8e0ef1833c7076513).

### 12. Informational - Non-standard `Redeem` event

The `Redeem` event in the implementation of PrincipalToken.sol is different from the one proposed in [EIP-5095](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095).

#### Technical Details

The `Redeem` event proposed in the [EIP-5095](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095#redeem-1) standard is composed of the from and to accounts and the amount of redeemed underlying.

However, the `Redeem` event defined in [Events.sol](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/Events.sol#L20-L21) has three addresses (caller, from, to) and both amounts (principal and underlying).

```solidity
20:     /// @dev `keccak256(bytes("Redeem(address,address,address,uint256,uint256)"))`.
21:     uint256 constant _REDEEM_EVENT_SIGNATURE = 0xaee47cdf925cf525fdae94f9777ee5a06cac37e1c41220d0a8a89ed154f62d1c;
```

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Consider changing the event to conform with the standard.

#### Developer Response

Acknowledged. There is a [comment](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/Events.sol#L61) about why we don't follow EIP5095.

### 13. Informational - Document router assumptions in the Zapper contract

The swap executed by the AggregationRouter.sol contract should check for the deadline. Additionally, it is assumed that the swap entirely consumes input when the operation is the first action executed by the Zapper logic.

#### Technical Details

All of the functions in the TwoCryptoZap.sol contract that involves an operation in the Curve pool have an explicit deadline check, while the others don't. As some of these functions that don't have an explicit deadline check also execute swaps using the AggregationRouter.sol contract, it is presumed that the underlying provider will include this check.

Similarly, some functions that use the router include a call to [`_refund()`](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/blob/cea0a6b96dd372c44dea5ce5cdb8d10c48f8da02/src/zap/TwoCryptoZap.sol#L1198), while others that have the swap operation as the first action do not. Since token input from function arguments is directly forwarded to the router, it is assumed that the underlying swap will entirely consume the input, leaving no necessity for a refund.

#### Impact

Informational.

#### Recommendation

Consider documenting these two assumptions.

#### Developer Response

Fixed [6b5a408](https://github.com/napierfi/napier-v2/pull/202/commits/6b5a4080bf25d428d18f543c98496f9377c306db)

## Final remarks

The Napier V2 codebase demonstrates solid engineering practices with well-structured code and comprehensive documentation. The review identified no critical or high-severity issues, indicating a robust core design. The few medium and low-severity findings mainly relate to edge cases and optimization opportunities rather than fundamental security concerns.
